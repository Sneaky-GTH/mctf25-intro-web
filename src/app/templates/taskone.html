    <h1>The Abandoned Archives</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            Welcome, wanderer. You have found your way into the digital remnants of forgotten places.
            Lost websites, deserted servers, decaying structures—both physical and virtual—live here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the world, countless locations sit untouched. Forgotten research labs,
            old municipal tunnels, shuttered observatories, empty storefronts whose domains
            still quietly point to 2008-era landing pages. Some abandoned websites continue
            to hum faintly on outdated hosting platforms, their creators long gone, their
            code drifting through the digital void.
        </p>

            Across the internet, there exist ghost-forums overflowing with broken image links,
            forgotten tutorials, and communities that once thrived. Old social networks that never
            reached launch day. Login portals for companies that no longer exist. Each one a relic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, real-world abandoned structures mark the landscape: old radio towers,
            decommissioned power plants, underground bunkers sealed off since the 60s.
            They stand as monuments to systems that once mattered.

            If you wish to begin your exploration, the first step is simple. Hidden pathways are
            rarely obvious—they often require interaction, intention, or curiosity. Press the button
            below to initiate the first step in the process of exploring the abandoned.
