    <p>It seems that whatever essay we submit, the server receives it and creates a new page out of it which we can go to.
        Seeing as this is a proofreading service, we can also presume that Kibi will read the essays we submit by visiting these pages. Let's keep that in mind!</p>
    <p><span style="color:lightgreen">Return to the essay submission main page to proceed.</span></p>
