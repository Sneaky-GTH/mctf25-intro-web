    <p>Welcome to the second second task! This shop is very much like the previous one, but with one difference that was already mentioned - it uses <span style="color: gray;">POST</span>! instead of <span style="color: gray;">GET</span> when making purchases!</p>
    <p>Since everything else is the same, let's skip the theatrics and get straight to business.</p>
    <p><span style="color:lightgreen">After opening the Network tab, try to purchase something!</span></p>
