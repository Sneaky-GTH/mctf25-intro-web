    <p>If you visited <span style="color: gray;">http://172.12.0.6/tasktwo/buy?product=hat&price=5</span> directly, you would notice that doing so actually purchased the hat!</p>
    <p>Let's take another look at the address - did you notice the question mark followed by words (often called "key-value pairs")? You can think of that as "data" that your browser is sending alongside your request.
    Think of it like this - you are sending a typical request to the server, but also telling the website that the "product" you're trying to buy is a "hat" (<span style="color: gray;">product=hat</span>) and that the "price" is "5" (<span style="color: gray;">price=5</span>).</p>
    <p>Now think to yourself... what if instead of sending a request where the price was 5... what if it was 0? Or even better, <span style="color:lightgreen">a negative number?</span></p>
