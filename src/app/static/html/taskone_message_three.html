    <p>Awesome! Now let's get into proper hacking. One of the most useful tools in web exploitation is simply checking the source code for a website. In the simplest of web tasks, this alone can get you a flag!</p>
    <p style="color: gray; font-size: 8x"><em>To view the source code, either use the shortcut "Ctrl+U" or right click and select "View Page Source"</em></p>
    <p>The source code of a website looks much like what you're looking at now, minus all the pretty graphics and plus all the "HTML tags",
        which represent a type of content. For instance, to divide this message into several paragraphs, I put each paragraph between &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;</p>
    <p>Dwelling too deep into HTML is outside the scope of this, but it'll pay off to familiarise yourself with inspecting the source code for websites, especially when dealing with web tasks, as that is where you'll often find vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p style="color:lightgreen">Check the source code of this website, look around, and when ready, submit the flag visible only in the source code to proceed!</p>
