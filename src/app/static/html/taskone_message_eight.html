<div style="max-width: 30vw;">
    <p>After clicking the button, somewhere in the <span style="color: gray;">Network</span> tab you should find two requests - one to <span style="color: gray;">hidden-data</span> and another to <span style="color: gray;">hidden-data-post</span>
        We already got the flag from <span style="color: gray;">hidden-data</span>, so click on the <span style="color: gray;">hidden-data-post</span> request!</p>
    <p>You should see another box open on your right. This contains all the information about the request, such as headers, what was requested and what the server responded. this is another tool I recommend familiarising yourself with, as it'll be very useful when hacking!</p>
    <p>In one of those tabs, you should also be able to find the flag.</p>
    <p><span style="color:lightgreen">Submit the flag to proceed!</span></p>
