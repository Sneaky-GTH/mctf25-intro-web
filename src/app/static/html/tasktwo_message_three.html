    <p>Did you notice one of the requests at the top? There should be a request with the <span style="color: gray;">GET</span> method that is sending a request to <span style="color: gray;">buy?product=hat&price=5</span>, though depending on your chosen product it may differ a bit.</p>
    <p>If you click on the request and check the box on the right, you'll notice that the request is formulated as <span style="color: gray;">GET http://172.12.0.6/tasktwo/buy?product=hat&price=5</span> (in your case the IP address might be different). Remember what we learnt previously about GET requests? This is kinda like visiting that site directly!</p>
    <p>Try and see what happens if you visit <span style="color: gray;">http://172.12.0.6/tasktwo/buy?product=hat&price=5</span> directly! (Changing the IP address to match, of course...)</p>
    <p style="color: gray; font-size: 8x"><em>If you are out of money, visit /tasktwo/reset to reset your money.</em></p>
    <p style="color:lightgreen">Purchase something by visiting the previously mentioned link to proceed!</p>
