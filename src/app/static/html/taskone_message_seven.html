    <p>Evidently we're going to need a different <em>method</em> (pun intended) to get the data. Thankfully, Firefox has a very powerful tool to do exactly that - Inspect.</p>
    <p style="color: gray; font-size: 8x"><em>To open Inspect, there are several options - use the shortcut "Ctrl+Shift+C", right click and press "Q" or right click and select "Inspect"</em></p>
    <p>Now be not afraid of all the sudden boxes and text that appeared on the bottom of the screen! The part we are most interested in is the <span style="color: gray;">Network</span> tab. Here you can see all the requests that your browser is making!
        You might notice one request being sent every few seconds which is "progress" - you can ignore that, that's things the server is requesting for this website to work.</p>
    <p>We're interested in a different type of request - remember how when clicking the button, our browser executed fetch() to try and get data from the server? Every request made by the browser, including fetch(), appears in the <span style="color: gray;">Network</span> tab!</p>
    <p>Try clicking the button and pay close attention to any requests that appear in the <span style="color: gray;">Network</span> tab.</p>
    <p><span style="color:lightgreen">Click the button to proceed!</span> (due to how I made this website, you need to close the pop-up to press the button. Oops!)</p>
